# JS dynamic loading

This is a very quick demo of dynamic loading in Javascript.

Run it with `npx http-server` , or your preferred alternative. Or view it on GitHub Pages: https://ukslim.github.io/js-dynamic-import-demo/ 

Change `lang="welsh"` to `lang="english"` to show how the 
Javascript can asynchronously load a different module depending
on configuration.
